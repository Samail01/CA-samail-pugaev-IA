Report.

I will try and explain what i changed on my website and why, i will start with the home page and then go further on with the other pages.

Home page:
The home page was one of the pages were i made the most changes. i changed the whole page, added a new navbar, changed the background image to a image that fit in better and also made a better footer. The people i sent the HotJar link to on my page liked the changes i made, however the recordings i have are from the older page and how it was before. As i said they liked the changes and said that the new page looked more professional.

Jackets page:
The jackets page didnt have that many changes, i only changed the colors a bit and added a "Add to Cart" button (one of the guys i sent the hotjar link to said that, i had to add some kind of button on the jackets and i did)

Jackets from 1-7:
Not so many changes on these pages either only added some small things and optimized the pictures. also added size options, however they dont work...

Cart: The cart is same as it was on the older page.

Checkout: Checkout is also same as it was before.

Order confirmation: is also as it was before.

About us: nothing special

Contact: made a different contact form, one that looks better and also added regex.

i tried adding adding JS to my navbar and in the start it worked, however went i made more and more changes it stopped being responsive
